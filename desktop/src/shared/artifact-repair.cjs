/**
 * artifact-repair.cjs — manual "repair components" escape hatch.
 * Automatic crash-loop recovery already bottoms out at the bundled seed;
 * this module handles an explicit user request for a clean reset
 * module is the manual override for when a user wants a clean reset
 * and is reachable from the tray menu (confirm dialog) and from the
 * `--repair-artifacts` CLI flag (no confirm — the flag itself is the
 * confirmation).
 *
 * Resets ONLY the artifact pipeline's own on-disk state under
 * `{HANA_HOME}/artifacts/` — pointers, both kinds' extracted version
 * directories, in-progress staging, the quarantine list, both boot
 * sentinels, and OTA bookkeeping — so the next launch takes the exact
 * same "no current pointer resolves" path a brand-new install takes: seed
 * re-extraction through the normal activation path. User data
 * (agents/sessions/config) lives entirely outside `artifacts/` and is
 * never touched.
 *
 * Deliberately a fixed ALLOWLIST of known subpaths (never a directory
 * walk + denylist): `rollout-id` (grey-rollout identity, not component
 * state) and `lock` (the flock file — ripping it out from under a
 * concurrent OTA cycle would be its own bug) simply never appear in the
 * list below. No separate "except" branch to get wrong, and no risk of a
 * future addition to the artifacts root getting swept up by accident.
