 * train-update-apply.cjs — pure decision/orchestration helpers for the

 * promote artifacts, restart the server, then reload renderer windows.
 *
 * Kept Electron- and IO-free on purpose so the ORDERING and FAIL-FAST
 * behavior of the apply-now sequence is unit-testable without spawning
 * real processes or touching the filesystem: desktop/main.cjs supplies the
 * actual step implementations (promote via the existing artifact-boot
 * chain, gracefully stop + respawn the server child process, reload
 * windows) and this module only guarantees the CONTRACT — steps run in
 * this fixed order, and a throwing step stops every step after it from
 * ever running, so a mid-sequence failure can never leave a "some of the
 * promote happened, spawn never got attempted" kind of ambiguity hidden
 * inside ad-hoc try/catch nesting at the call site.
 *
 * This module does not reimplement or bypass anything in
 * shared/artifact-core/** or artifact-boot.cjs's boot semantics — it is
 * purely a sequencing/guard layer around calls main.cjs makes into that
 * already-hardened machinery.
