/**
 * artifact-ota.cjs — hot-update train check + download/apply, split into
 * two entry points on purpose:
 *
 *   `checkOnce` — safe to run automatically on a timer. Fetches the channel
 *   manifest, verifies it, runs every gate, and figures out whether a real
 *   update exists. It NEVER writes an archive to disk, NEVER extracts
 *   anything, and NEVER touches a pointer file. The only disk writes are
 *   bookkeeping: `ota-state.json` (what did the last check find) and the
 *   per-install rollout-id file. Every failure is caught, logged, and
 *   recorded in `ota-state.json`; this function never rejects.
 *
 *   `downloadAndApplyArtifacts` — the only function in this module allowed
 *   to write an archive to disk or call `activateFromArchive`. It is only
 *   ever meant to run because a person clicked something: automatic
 *   background code must never call it. It re-fetches the manifest
 *   (bypassing the ETag cache, since the shelf may have moved since the
 *   last check), re-runs every gate (the shelf may have moved), stages both
 *   archives with progress callbacks, then activates server before
 *   renderer.
 *
 * Why the split exists: the previous single `checkAndDownloadOnce` function
 * did "check + download + stage + activate" as one silent background
 * operation on a timer, and a bug in the activation step could corrupt the
 * active installation before it was root-caused and fixed.
 * The fix for that bug is `activateFromArchive`'s current claim/refuse
 * semantics; this split is the second half of the fix — no code path may
 * write bytes to an artifacts directory without a human in the loop.
 *
 * Gate order (both entry points), each short-circuits the rest on failure:
 *   fetch channel manifest: races BOTH sources in parallel — GitHub (the
 *   release origin) and AtomGit (an accelerator mirror) — verifies
 *   whichever side(s) respond, and keeps the higher-train side when both
 *   verify (ETag-cached per-source for checkOnce, ETag-bypassed for
 *   downloadAndApplyArtifacts); see the "dual-source manifest fetch" note
 *   below for the full rationale
 *     -> ed25519 verify + schema validate happens INSIDE the fetch step
 *        above now (one atomic call per candidate into the protected
 *        artifact-core `manifest.verifyManifest` — see the "verify-order
 *        note" below), because the fetch step needs each candidate's
 *        `train` number to pick a winner
 *     -> channel namespace assertion (checkOnce/downloadAndApplyArtifacts
 *        only, on the winning manifest — see the "channel assertion" note
 *        below): the manifest's own `channel` field must equal the channel
 *        that was actually requested
 *     -> train monotonic, SOFTENED for checkOnce: a train that is not
 *        strictly newer than the currently activated train is reported as
 *        "up-to-date", not an error (a background check finding nothing
 *        new is normal, not exceptional). downloadAndApplyArtifacts keeps
 *        this as a hard failure — there is nothing to apply.
 *     -> content reconciliation (checkOnce only): even when the train
 *        number did advance, if this platform's server entry and the
 *        renderer entry both hash to exactly what's already recorded on
 *        the `current` pointer, there is no real update — report
 *        "up-to-date" rather than surfacing a phantom "new version"
 *        because a release got re-cut with the same bytes under a new
 *        train number. The same "up-to-date" outcome is also reported when
 *        the version numbers already match even if the bytes don't — a
 *        version directory is named after the version number, so content
 *        stamped with a version that's already activated can never be
 *        applied anyway, regardless of what its sha256 says (see
 *        `isVersionAlreadyCurrent`'s doc comment).
 *     -> minShell (shell too old -> the update is real but blocked; the
 *        shell's own update is electron-updater's job, not this module's)
 *     -> preload contract (same shape as minShell, one level more specific:
 *        this train's renderer needs a preload API version this shell
 *        doesn't expose yet; reported through the same "minshell-blocked"
 *        outcome, see `isPreloadContractSatisfied`)
 *     -> rollout bucket (dedicated random UUID in HANA_HOME)
 *     -> quarantine short-circuit (train permanently blacklisted)
 *     -> [downloadAndApplyArtifacts only] acquire the artifacts directory
 *        lock (the loser fails this call — someone else is already
 *        updating) -> stage both archives (renderer + this platform's
 *        server) to `staging/`, mirror failover per archive, size-capped,
 *        streamed, atomic rename, sha256-verified, with progress reported
 *        through `onProgress` -> `activateFromArchive` per kind (extract +
 *        `.verified` + write that kind's `next` pointer) — server first,
 *        then renderer; if renderer's activation fails, the server `next`
 *        pointer written a moment earlier is rolled back
 *        (`pointerStore.clearPointer`) so "either both next pointers land
 *        or neither does" holds even though `activateFromArchive` itself
 *        only guarantees atomicity per kind, not across the two calls (see
 *        the "why a rollback" note below) -> staging cleaned up in a
 *        `finally`, lock released in a `finally`
 *
 * Activation to `current` happens at the NEXT LAUNCH, entirely inside
 * `desktop/src/shared/artifact-boot.cjs`; both kinds use the same promotion contract:
 * both `prepareArtifactServerBoot` and `prepareArtifactRendererBoot`
 * call `pointerStore.promote(homeDir, <their channel>)` as the first thing
 * they do). `downloadAndApplyArtifacts` writes `next` pointers and nothing
 * else — it never promotes, never touches `current`/`previous` itself;
 * promotion happens through the existing apply-now sequence
 * (`train-update-apply.cjs`) or at the next ordinary launch. A running
 * session is never hot-swapped by this module.
 *
 * Verify-order note: callers require both schema validation and signature
 * verification before any manifest field is trusted. The sole
 * sanctioned entry point for both checks,
 * `shared/artifact-core/manifest.cjs#verifyManifest` (protected, consumed
 * not modified), internally does JSON-parse-and-schema-validate FIRST and
 * ed25519-verify SECOND, bundled into one atomic call — no manifest content
 * is ever trusted or acted on until BOTH have passed, which is the
 * externally observable guarantee that matters here. Re-deriving
 * a parallel raw-signature-first check in this file would duplicate the
 * keyset-lookup + `crypto.verify` logic that already lives in exactly one
 * place. Because `validateManifest` is side-effect-free type/shape checking
 * on a small bounded buffer (no parser-injection surface the way an
 * XML/YAML parser would have), the net security delta between the two
 * orderings is negligible.
 *
 * Dual-source manifest fetch (why a race, not a priority order): the user
 * base is China-heavy, where GitHub is the unreliable hop — but GitHub is
 * also the release origin, the only source guaranteed fresh the moment a
 * train ships. A mirror (AtomGit) that only gets mirrored occasionally can
 * silently freeze every client on it at "already up to date" for as long as
 * the mirror job lags, with zero visible symptom. Picking one of
 * "mirror-first" or "origin-first" as a fixed sequential order always
 * trades one failure mode for the other (mirror-first risks silent
 * freezing; origin-first risks slow/unreliable checks for the China-heavy
 * base). Racing both in parallel avoids the trade entirely: whichever side
 * answers becomes usable, and when both answer, the one with the strictly
 * higher `train` number wins (a tie keeps the origin's copy — "相等取产地
 * 那份" — since both should be byte-identical announcements of the same
 * release and origin needs no extra trust bonus, it's just the tiebreak
 * default). GitHub gets its own short race budget
 * (`ORIGIN_MANIFEST_RACE_TIMEOUT_MS`, 8s) layered under the existing 30s
 * per-hop idle timeout so a slow/unreachable origin never holds up a round
 * whose mirror leg already answered; the mirror leg keeps the full 30s
 * budget since it isn't racing against anything. No re-signing, expiry, or
 * staleness-threshold machinery is needed anywhere in this scheme — the
 * comparison is a single monotonic integer (`train`) that both sides
 * either agree on or don't, and quietly using a lagging mirror's ANSWER
 * (not its absence) is not a failure mode this design needs to guard
 * against: an honest mirror only ever reports a `train` number it actually
 * has, so if it's behind, the origin's higher number simply wins whenever
 * origin is reachable, and the whole "how do I know this manifest hasn't
 * gone stale" question this design deliberately declines to introduce.
 * A per-source boolean (`originUnreachable`, persisted in `ota-state.json`
 * and returned by `readStagedTrainStatus`) records whether the origin
 * failed to contribute a verified candidate THIS round, independent of
 * which side ultimately won — it exists purely so the settings page can
 * show a neutral "(via backup source)" annotation only when the origin
 * genuinely didn't participate, not merely when the mirror happened to
 * have the newer train.
 *
 * Channel assertion (why it lives in checkOnce/downloadAndApplyArtifacts,
 * not deeper): `verifyManifest` is a context-free validator — it has no
 * idea which channel the caller actually asked for, only whether the bytes
 * it was handed are well-formed and validly signed by SOME known key. The
 * dual-source race/selection logic one level up (inside
 * `fetchChannelManifest`) only ever compares "is this candidate verified"
 * and "which train is higher" — it doesn't know channel semantics either,
 * by design, so a signature/schema failure on one side can never poison
 * the other side's otherwise-valid candidate. The channel pointer
 * namespace (`stable` vs `beta`, etc.) is a concept that only the caller
 * of `checkOnce`/`downloadAndApplyArtifacts` — the code that decided which
 * channel to poll in the first place — actually holds. So the one and only
 * place a signed-but-wrong-channel manifest (e.g. a validly-signed `beta`
 * manifest served back from a `stable` URL, whether by misconfiguration or
 * attack) gets rejected is right here, immediately after the winning
 * manifest comes back trusted and before any pointer/version logic runs.
 *
 * Why a rollback instead of a true joint write: `activateFromArchive` is
 * the sole path by which an archive becomes a bootable version (extract +
 * `.verified` + `next`-pointer write, all in one call) and intentionally
 * encapsulates that transaction. It cannot be split into "extract" and "write pointer"
 * phases without forking or modifying that module. Calling it once per
 * kind and rolling back the first kind's pointer if the second kind's
 * call throws reaches the same externally-observable outcome ("either
 * both next pointers exist afterward, or neither does") using only
 * exported, unmodified artifact-core functions.
 *
 * Node built-ins only (https/crypto/fs/path) — zero new dependencies.
