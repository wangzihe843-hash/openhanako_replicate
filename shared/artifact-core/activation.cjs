/**
 * shared/artifact-core/activation.cjs
 *
 * Archive activation + boot resolution + crash-sentinel primitives for
 * signed runtime artifacts.
 *
 * `activateFromArchive` is the sole path by which a downloaded (or seed)
 * archive becomes a bootable version: quarantine short-circuit -> sha256
 * verify -> [protection check] -> extract into a temp dir -> `.verified`
 * receipt -> atomic swap into the versioned directory -> `next` pointer
 * write. Boot itself never re-hashes trees; it trusts the `.verified`
 * receipt plus the pointer's own signed-manifest provenance
 * (`resolveBoot`).
 *
 * Two invariants this module exists to hold, both learned from a real
 * incident (an update train reusing the same version-directory name as
 * the build a user was actively running; on Windows the old code's
 * unconditional `rm` of that directory hit a file locked by the running
 * process and aborted mid-delete, leaving a half-installed app):
 *
 * 1. Build-new-before-removing-old. The archive is extracted into a
 *    sibling temp directory first; the live/final directory is only
 *    touched once the new content is fully staged and its `.verified`
 *    receipt written. If extraction fails, the final directory is left
 *    exactly as it was — there is never a state where the old content
 *    has been removed but the new content isn't in place yet.
 * 2. A version directory currently referenced by ANY pointer (any
 *    channel, any slot — current/previous/next) is protected. If the
 *    incoming archive's sha256 matches what that pointer already
 *    recorded, the directory is claimed as-is for the new pointer write
 *    (no filesystem writes at all — this is the "same train re-announced,
 *    or a rollback re-announcing an old version" case). If the sha256
 *    differs, activation is refused with a loud error instead of silently
 *    overwriting a directory something else still depends on. Callers
 *    that need to bypass this (first-boot seed extraction and crash
 *    self-repair, where nothing has started running yet) opt in via
 *    `opts.allowReplaceProtected`.
