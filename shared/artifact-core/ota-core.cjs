/**
 * shared/artifact-core/ota-core.cjs — hot-update train check + download/
 * apply pipeline core: check, verify, download, activate. This is the part
 * of the OTA water pipe any future consumer (desktop shell today, a
 * server/CLI form tomorrow) can run without importing anything under
 * desktop/ — no Electron, no shell timer wiring, no dev-only transport
 * override required statically. The desktop shell
 * (`desktop/src/shared/artifact-ota.cjs`) is a thin wrapper: it keeps the
 * static `require("./artifact-ota-dev-bypass.cjs")` (vite's bundle-time
 * alias swap depends on that exact literal specifier) and injects the real
 * dev-bypass module into every entry point here via an explicit
 * `devBypass` opt; every function below defaults to "no override, ever"
 * when the caller doesn't pass one (see `NO_DEV_OVERRIDE`). The shell also
 * owns `scheduleBackgroundOtaChecks` (setTimeout/setInterval cadence) and
 * `hasDevOverrideConfigured` — pure shell timer/wiring concerns, not part
 * of the pipeline itself.
 *
 * Split into two entry points on purpose:
 *
 *   `checkOnce` — safe to run automatically on a timer. Fetches the channel
 *   manifest, verifies it, runs every gate, and figures out whether a real
 *   update exists. It NEVER writes an archive to disk, NEVER extracts
 *   anything, and NEVER touches a pointer file. The only disk writes are
 *   bookkeeping: `ota-state.json` (what did the last check find) and the
 *   per-install rollout-id file. Every failure is caught, logged, and
 *   recorded in `ota-state.json`; this function never rejects.
 *
 *   `downloadAndApplyArtifacts` — the only function in this module allowed
 *   to write an archive to disk or call `activateFromArchive`. It is only
 *   ever meant to run because a person clicked something: automatic
 *   background code must never call it. It re-fetches the manifest
 *   (bypassing the ETag cache, since the shelf may have moved since the
 *   last check), re-runs every gate (the shelf may have moved), stages both
 *   archives with progress callbacks, then activates server before
 *   renderer.
 *
 * Why the split exists: the previous single `checkAndDownloadOnce` function
 * did "check + download + stage + activate" as one silent background
 * operation on a timer, and a bug in the activation step could corrupt the
 * active installation before it was root-caused and fixed.
 * The fix for that bug is `activateFromArchive`'s current claim/refuse
 * semantics; this split is the second half of the fix — no code path may
 * write bytes to an artifacts directory without a human in the loop.
 *
 * Gate order (both entry points), each short-circuits the rest on failure:
 *   fetch the GitHub channel manifest once (ETag-cached for checkOnce,
 *   ETag-bypassed for downloadAndApplyArtifacts)
 *     -> ed25519 verify + schema validate happens INSIDE the fetch step
 *        above (one atomic call into the protected artifact-core
 *        `manifest.verifyManifest` — see the "verify-order note" below)
 *     -> channel namespace assertion (checkOnce/downloadAndApplyArtifacts
 *        only, on the winning manifest — see the "channel assertion" note
 *        below): the manifest's own `channel` field must equal the channel
 *        that was actually requested
 *     -> train monotonic, SOFTENED for checkOnce: a train that is not
 *        strictly newer than the currently activated train is reported as
 *        "up-to-date", not an error (a background check finding nothing
 *        new is normal, not exceptional). downloadAndApplyArtifacts keeps
 *        this as a hard failure — there is nothing to apply.
 *     -> content reconciliation (checkOnce only): even when the train
 *        number did advance, if this platform's server entry and the
 *        renderer entry both hash to exactly what's already recorded on
 *        the `current` pointer, there is no real update — report
 *        "up-to-date" rather than surfacing a phantom "new version"
 *        because a release got re-cut with the same bytes under a new
 *        train number. The same "up-to-date" outcome is also reported when
 *        the version numbers already match even if the bytes don't — a
 *        version directory is named after the version number, so content
 *        stamped with a version that's already activated can never be
 *        applied anyway, regardless of what its sha256 says (see
 *        `isVersionAlreadyCurrent`'s doc comment).
 *     -> minShell (shell too old -> the update is real but blocked; the
 *        shell's own update is electron-updater's job, not this module's)
 *     -> preload contract (same shape as minShell, one level more specific:
 *        this train's renderer needs a preload API version this shell
 *        doesn't expose yet; reported through the same "minshell-blocked"
 *        outcome, see `isPreloadContractSatisfied`)
 *     -> rollout bucket (dedicated random UUID in HANA_HOME)
 *     -> quarantine short-circuit (train permanently blacklisted)
 *     -> [downloadAndApplyArtifacts only] acquire the artifacts directory
 *        lock (the loser fails this call — someone else is already
 *        updating) -> stage both archives (renderer + this platform's
 *        server) to `staging/`, mirror failover per archive, size-capped,
 *        streamed, atomic rename, sha256-verified, with progress reported
 *        through `onProgress` -> `activateFromArchive` per kind (extract +
 *        `.verified` + write that kind's `next` pointer) — server first,
 *        then renderer; if renderer's activation fails, the server `next`
 *        pointer written a moment earlier is rolled back
 *        (`pointerStore.clearPointer`) so "either both next pointers land
 *        or neither does" holds even though `activateFromArchive` itself
 *        only guarantees atomicity per kind, not across the two calls (see
 *        the "why a rollback" note below) -> staging cleaned up in a
 *        `finally`, lock released in a `finally`
 *
 * Activation to `current` happens at the NEXT LAUNCH, entirely inside
 * `desktop/src/shared/artifact-boot.cjs`; both kinds use the same promotion contract:
 * both `prepareArtifactServerBoot` and `prepareArtifactRendererBoot`
 * call `pointerStore.promote(homeDir, <their channel>)` as the first thing
 * they do). `downloadAndApplyArtifacts` writes `next` pointers and nothing
 * else — it never promotes, never touches `current`/`previous` itself;
 * promotion happens through the existing apply-now sequence
 * (`train-update-apply.cjs`) or at the next ordinary launch. A running
 * session is never hot-swapped by this module.
 *
 * Verify-order note: callers require both schema validation and signature
 * verification before any manifest field is trusted. The sole
 * sanctioned entry point for both checks,
 * `shared/artifact-core/manifest.cjs#verifyManifest` (protected, consumed
 * not modified), internally does JSON-parse-and-schema-validate FIRST and
 * ed25519-verify SECOND, bundled into one atomic call — no manifest content
 * is ever trusted or acted on until BOTH have passed, which is the
 * externally observable guarantee that matters here. Re-deriving
 * a parallel raw-signature-first check in this file would duplicate the
 * keyset-lookup + `crypto.verify` logic that already lives in exactly one
 * place. Because `validateManifest` is side-effect-free type/shape checking
 * on a small bounded buffer (no parser-injection surface the way an
 * XML/YAML parser would have), the net security delta between the two
 * orderings is negligible.
 *
 * Public channel lookup deliberately has one source and one bounded
 * attempt: GitHub. A failed round is recorded and returned to the UI so a
 * person can press Retry again; the transport never performs a hidden
 * source switch or an internal retry loop. Detached signature verification,
 * ETag handling, and the trusted archive URLs inside a verified manifest
 * remain unchanged.
 *
 * Channel assertion (why it lives in checkOnce/downloadAndApplyArtifacts,
 * not deeper): `verifyManifest` is a context-free validator — it has no
 * idea which channel the caller actually asked for, only whether the bytes
 * it was handed are well-formed and validly signed by SOME known key. The
 * fetch logic one level up (inside `fetchChannelManifest`) verifies bytes
 * but doesn't know channel semantics either. The channel pointer
 * namespace (`stable` vs `beta`, etc.) is a concept that only the caller
 * of `checkOnce`/`downloadAndApplyArtifacts` — the code that decided which
 * channel to poll in the first place — actually holds. So the one and only
 * place a signed-but-wrong-channel manifest (e.g. a validly-signed `beta`
 * manifest served back from a `stable` URL, whether by misconfiguration or
 * attack) gets rejected is right here, immediately after the
 * manifest comes back trusted and before any pointer/version logic runs.
 *
 * Why a rollback instead of a true joint write: `activateFromArchive` is
 * the sole path by which an archive becomes a bootable version (extract +
 * `.verified` + `next`-pointer write, all in one call) and intentionally
 * encapsulates that transaction. It cannot be split into "extract" and "write pointer"
 * phases without forking or modifying that module. Calling it once per
 * kind and rolling back the first kind's pointer if the second kind's
 * call throws reaches the same externally-observable outcome ("either
 * both next pointers exist afterward, or neither does") using only
 * exported, unmodified artifact-core functions.
 *
 * Node built-ins only (https/crypto/fs/path) — zero new dependencies.

// ── downloadAndApplyRendererArtifact: renderer-only pull for the
//    self-hosted form (`hana bundle pull`) ────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Renderer-only variant of `downloadAndApplyArtifacts` for the self-hosted
 * form: the operator installs and upgrades the server themselves (it's
 * their package manager's job), and only ever pulls the WEB FRONTEND
 * (renderer box) from the release shelf. The server artifact is never
 * downloaded, never activated, and its pointer namespace is never touched
 * — operator sovereignty over the server binary is the line this function
 * must never cross.
 *
 * Runs only because an operator typed a command (`hana bundle pull`) —
 * the same human-in-the-loop rule `downloadAndApplyArtifacts` carries; no
 * timer, daemon, or background code may ever call this.
 *
 * Gates kept from the desktop pipeline (same semantics): signed GitHub
 * manifest fetch, channel namespace
 * assertion, renderer version already-current short-circuit, train
 * monotonic, version never goes backward, quarantine — plus the
 * serverProtocol contract gate, which replaces the desktop's preload gate
 * as "is the host new enough for this content" (see
 * `isServerProtocolSatisfied`'s doc comment).
 *
 * Gates deliberately SKIPPED, because the desktop concepts behind them do
 * not exist in the self-hosted form:
 *   - minShell: there is no Electron shell here to be "too old" — the
 *     operator's server is the host, and its compatibility is exactly what
 *     the serverProtocol contract gate checks instead.
 *   - rollout bucketing: rollout percentages exist to stagger AUTOMATIC
 *     background updates across a fleet of desktop installs; an operator
 *     explicitly typing `hana bundle pull` is a full-intent action, and
 *     gradual rollout must never hold an explicit command back.
 *   - preload contract: the preload API is an Electron shell surface; a
 *     browser-served frontend has no preload bridge at all.
 *
 * PROMOTES IMMEDIATELY after activation — the one deliberate behavioral
 * difference from the desktop pipeline, which writes `next` and leaves the
 * promote for the next launch. The desktop defers promotion so
 * artifact-boot's crash-fallback chain can demote a train that keeps
 * crashing the app at startup. Here the operator explicitly asked for the
 * update NOW, and the renderer box is static files served over HTTP —
 * nothing from it executes inside the server process, so there is no
 * startup-crash loop for a deferred promote to protect against;
 * `previous` still records the prior version for manual recovery.
 * "Restart `hana serve` to take effect" remains the operator's step
 * because the running server resolved its renderer root at boot.
 *
 * @param {{homeDir: string, keyset: Array<{keyId:string, publicKey:string}>,

 *   `devBypass` defaults to "no override, ever" (see `NO_DEV_OVERRIDE`);
 *   the CLI never passes one — only tests inject a local-fixture stub.
 *   `overallReceivedBytes`/`overallTotalBytes` mirror the fields
 *   `downloadAndApplyArtifacts` adds for its two-artifact progress bar;
 *   here there is only ever one artifact, so they always equal the

// handler (desktop/main.cjs) to ask "is a train fully staged and ready to

// a pure READ — it never writes a pointer, never downloads, never touches
// `current`/`previous`. The actual promote step still only ever happens
// through the existing artifact-boot chain (prepareArtifactServerBoot /
// prepareArtifactRendererBoot), exactly as at ordinary boot.

 * torn write) must never be treated as ready — this mirrors the "either
