/**
 * shared/server-info-probe.cjs — token-authenticated liveness probe for
 * `server-info.json` entries.
 *
 * Threat model (同宅防线 / same-HANA_HOME mutual exclusion):
 * A single HANA_HOME can be opened by more than one kernel binary on the
 * same machine — `hana serve` (standalone CLI) and the desktop app are the
 * two shipped entry points, and a user can start either one first. If two
 * kernels hold the same SQLite files / session JSONLs / server-info.json
 * open at once, concurrent writes corrupt state silently. The existing
 * defenses (desktop's own `verifyReusableServerInfo` reuse check, the
 * `resolveStaleServerInfoDisposition` residual-process disposition, and
 * bare-port EADDRINUSE) all leave one hole open: a residual process that is
 * alive, cannot be verified as *this* desktop's own reusable server, but
 * does not conflict on the desired port — that branch used to fall through
 * to spawning a second server anyway, because "port doesn't conflict" was
 * being used as a proxy for "safe to start alongside it". It isn't: the
 * residual process may well be a live, healthy kernel on the very same
 * HANA_HOME, just listening on a different port (e.g. `hana serve` started
 * first, desktop started second).
 *
 * This module closes that hole with a single, reusable question: "is the
 * process described by this server-info.json record still alive, and is it
 * provably the same home?" Provably means it accepts the 128-bit
 * SERVER_TOKEN written into that very server-info.json — anyone who can
 * present that token has already had filesystem read access to this
 * HANA_HOME, so a token match is as strong an identity signal as this
 * machine can offer locally.
 *
 * Why not trust the bare PID (the classic postmaster.pid mistake)? PIDs
 * get recycled by the OS; a dead kernel's PID can be reassigned to an
 * unrelated process by the time the next kernel starts, and a naive
 * "is this PID alive" check would then block startup forever on a false
 * positive, or (worse) silently coexist with a process that merely reused
 * the number. Requiring the process behind the PID to also answer a
 * token-authenticated HTTP call removes that whole class of misjudgment:
 * a residual lock is trusted only if it can prove it is still speaking for
 * the same home, not merely occupying the same process table slot.
 *
 * probeServerInfo() classifies the record into exactly four states:
 *   - "alive-same-home"   — the endpoint answered 200 with a body shaped
 *                            like this server's own identity route, using
 *                            the token from server-info.json. This is
 *                            unambiguously the same home, still running.
 *   - "alive-unauthorized"— something answered on that port and rejected
 *                           the token the way this codebase's auth
 *                           middleware rejects bad bearer tokens (403 with
 *                           an `error`/`reason` body). Most likely a Hana
 *                           kernel whose token has since rotated, or a
 *                           different HANA_HOME's kernel that happens to be
 *                           listening on the same port. Either way it is
 *                           not verifiably foreign, so it is treated as
 *                           blocking too (see isForeignServerBlocking).
 *   - "not-hana"           — something answered, but neither the 200 nor
 *                            the 403 shape matches what this server ever
 *                            produces (e.g. an unrelated HTTP service
 *                            occupies that port, or a stale record points
 *                            at a totally different process by now).
 *   - "dead"                — no response at all (connection refused,
 *                              reset, or timed out). The residual lock file
 *                              is provably stale.
 *
 * "not-hana" and "dead" both mean the recorded server-info.json cannot be
 * defended as still representing a live kernel — callers are expected to
 * delete the stale record and proceed, the same "self-cleaning" affordance
 * Postgres's postmaster.pid never had (its crash-residue lock requires a
 * human to delete the file by hand).
