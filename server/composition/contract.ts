/**
 * server composition contract (open) — the route composition seam.
 *
 * `server/index.ts` is the open composition root: it unconditionally,
 * statically imports `./open-root.ts` and mounts every open
 * (redistributable) route/WS surface on the shared Hono `app`. It no
 * longer imports any closed-product route file directly.
 *
 * The full product composition (today the only composition anything
 * actually boots) additionally needs the closed-product routes — avatar,
 * cards, character-cards, desk, diary. Rather than `server/index.ts`
 * reaching for those itself, it accepts an optional `registerClosedRoutes`
 * hook on the `root` argument passed to `startServer(root)`. That hook is
 * supplied by `server/main-full.ts` (a closed, thin entry point) via
 * `./full-root.ts` (closed). `server/index.ts` itself never imports either
 * file — the `?.()` call site is a static composition-time parameter, not a
 * runtime feature switch: which composition is selected is decided once, at
 * the process-entry level (which file gets spawned/imported), never by an
 * env var or config flag read inside `startServer`.
 *
 * `ctx` carries every dependency a route factory needs explicitly (engine,
 * hub, ws plumbing, per-request-scoped services) so closed route
 * registration never has to reach for a global singleton or guess at
 * server/index.ts's internal state.
