/**
 * compute-cli-closure.mjs — CLI distribution/runtime closure census
 *
 * Generates `build/cli-runtime-closure.json`: the mechanical answer to
 * "which repo files (plus third-party runtime files) does the standalone
 * `hana` CLI + its spawned server composition need to distribute and run".
 * The open/closed source split for this project is defined as "everything
 * required to distribute and run the CLI", not as a single static-import
 * walk from one entrypoint -- this script computes that closure so the
 * definition is a generated fact, not a manually maintained list.
 *
 * Why a single import walk from cli/entry.ts is not enough: the CLI
 * launches the server through cli/server-runner.ts's spawnServerForeground
 * / startLocalServerAndWait by PATH + CHILD PROCESS (see
 * resolveServerSpawnSpec), never by statically importing server/index.ts.
 * A one-root walk would therefore produce a false, unusably small cut.
 *
 * Four evidence sources are merged (see CLOSURE_ROOTS below for the exact
 * roots and RUNTIME_ASSETS for the fourth):
 *   1. the CLI's own static/dynamic source module graph (esbuild metafile,
 *      rooted at cli/entry.ts);
 *   2. declared dynamic process/build roots -- server/index.ts (the server
 *      bootstrap cli/server-runner.ts spawns by path in source mode, and
 *      the build entry scripts/build-server.mjs feeds to
 *      vite.config.server.js) and server/bootstrap.ts (the packaged-mode
 *      spawn target scripts/build-server.mjs copies verbatim) -- each root
 *      gets its own source module graph too;
 *   3. @vercel/nft traces of the compiled bundles for the CLI and server
 *      roots, for bundle externals / third-party runtime files -- same nft
 *      usage pattern as the server build's pruneServerNodeModulesViaNft()
 *      in scripts/build-server-phases.mjs (read-only precedent, not
 *      modified here). Target-built `.node` addon binaries are excluded
 *      because the server build installs them with the target
 *      server runtime; their local presence depends on npm install-script
 *      policy and is not a stable repository-closure input;
 *   4. an explicit, evidence-backed inventory of non-import runtime assets
 *      (package.json, lib/ model + identity/AGENTS.md template data) that
 *      core code reads via fs.readFileSync/path.join rather than
 *      import/require, so no static graph walk or nft trace can find them.
 *
 * Tool choice for sources 1/2: a bare `nodeFileTrace` pointed directly at
 * the TS entries (cli/entry.ts, server/index.ts) fails -- its acorn parser
 * cannot parse TypeScript syntax ("Failed to parse ... as module:
 * Unexpected token") and the resulting fileList only contains the entry
 * files themselves. esbuild is already a devDependency (package.json), so
 * its `metafile` output (bundle: true, write: false, packages: "external")
 * is used for the source module graph instead: it strips TypeScript,
 * resolves the real internal import graph, and leaves every bare
 * (npm-package) specifier as `external` so it does not try to bundle
 * third-party code. nft is reserved for source 3, where it is pointed at
 * an esbuild-compiled bundle (TypeScript already stripped) -- matching
 * build-server.mjs's own nft usage, which also traces compiled output
 * rather than TS source.
 *
 * nft safety note: nodeFileTrace's default `analysis.emitGlobs: true`
 * heuristic will, when it cannot statically resolve a require()/import()
 * argument, fall back to speculative glob-style directory search. In this
 * repository that fallback is dangerous -- there are multiple git
 * worktrees nested under .claude/worktrees/ plus large unrelated caches
 * under .cache/, and the heuristic was empirically observed pulling in
 * unrelated files from a sibling worktree and a Swift build cache purely
 * because their relative path fragments happened to match an unresolvable
 * string it found in the bundle (esbuild's own CJS-interop module-wrapper
 * keys, which are *not* real import/require calls). This generator
 * disables `emitGlobs` and adds explicit `ignore` patterns for those
 * directories as defense in depth. The tradeoff: a handful of third-party
 * packages that legitimately load "every file in this directory" at
 * runtime (e.g. locale packs) via a non-literal require will not have
 * those directory contents traced. That is judged acceptable here because
 * this script produces a classification census, not build-server.mjs's
 * shippable, size-trimmed artifact -- build-server.mjs's own nft call
 * (default emitGlobs, run from an isolated dist-server/* output directory
 * with no sibling worktrees nearby) remains the source of truth for what
 * actually ships.
 *
 * Fail-closed behaviors (never silently shrink the closure):
 *   - a declared root or runtime asset that does not exist on disk is a
 *     hard error;
 *   - any `import()`/`require()`/child_process spawn-family call whose
 *     first argument is not a plain string literal is a hard error unless
 *     it exactly matches an entry in DYNAMIC_CALL_ALLOWLIST (file + callee
 *     + argument text) -- matching is by call-site text, not line number,
 *     so unrelated edits elsewhere in a file cannot silently invalidate an
 *     allowlist entry, but a changed call site will fail closed until a
 *     human re-reasons about it;
 *   - every allowlist entry must also be *matched* by a real scan hit, so
 *     a call site that is refactored away leaves no stale, unverifiable
 *     allowlist entry behind.
 *
 * Usage: `node scripts/compute-cli-closure.mjs` regenerates
 * build/cli-runtime-closure.json and build/open-boundary-baseline.json in
 * place. Re-running with an unchanged tree produces byte-identical output
 * (all lists are sorted; no timestamps are embedded).
