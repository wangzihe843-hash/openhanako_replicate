 * The one place that names the directory where migrations park their backups.

 * The name used to be spelled independently by every module that touched it:
 * the migrations that copy the provider catalog aside, the retention pass that
 * prunes old copies, and the startup pass that tightens their permissions. That
 * shape has already cost real coverage elsewhere in this area, where a list of
 * directories to walk drifted from the name its writer actually used and the
 * pass ended up scanning a path that never existed, silently doing nothing.
 * Import the name from here rather than spelling it again.
