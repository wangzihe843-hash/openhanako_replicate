/**
 * Retention policy for the migration backups that hold copies of credentials.
 *
 * Migrations copy the provider catalog aside before rewriting it, so a rollback
 * is possible if the rewrite goes wrong. Those copies contain the same
 * credentials as the live catalog, and nothing removed them afterwards, so a
 * credential a user removed from the application could still exist in a copy
 * indefinitely. That gap between what the user removed and what remains on disk
 * is what this closes.
 *
 * Removal is not reversible, so it only happens when the backup has stopped
 * being useful on both counts: it is older than the retention window, and the
 * live catalog it could roll back to is readable and populated. If the live
 * catalog is missing, unparseable, or empty, every backup is kept regardless of
 * age, because that is exactly the situation a rollback exists for. Each
 * decision is logged, kept ones included, so the policy is auditable rather
 * than silent.
 *
 * The health check deliberately reads and parses the catalog file directly
 * instead of going through the catalog store: the store's loader falls back to
 * migrating the legacy file when the catalog is absent, which would make a
 * cleanup pass rewrite state as a side effect of asking a question.
 *
 * Deleting this module means dropping its single call in the engine startup
 * sequence; nothing else depends on it.
