/**
 * Auto-compaction runtime wiring for a live session.
 *
 * Two pieces, both installed right after a session is created:
 *
 *   1. A proportional compaction reserve. The Pi SDK triggers auto-compaction
 *      when contextTokens exceeds `contextWindow - reserveTokens`, and a fixed
 *      reserve of 16384 tokens is meaningless once the model window is in the
 *      millions: the trigger point sits at 98%+ of the window, so in practice
 *      the session overflows before it ever compacts. The reserve is therefore
 *      derived from the live window as `max(16384, 10% of window)`, which puts
 *      the trigger at `min(90% of window, window - 16384)` — the smaller of a
 *      proportional headroom and the original absolute headroom.
 *
 *   2. Mid-run compaction. The SDK only checks the threshold after a whole
 *      agentic run finishes and before a new prompt, so a single long tool loop
 *      can run far past the window with zero checks. The agent loop hands every
 *      turn to `prepareNextTurnWithContext` and adopts the context that call
 *      returns, which makes it the one supported seam where history can be
 *      swapped mid-run. The hook is wrapped (never replaced) so the SDK's own
 *      layer keeps working, and a compaction failure is swallowed: the run
 *      continues and the SDK's post-run check remains the backstop.
 *
 * After a mid-run compaction the model would otherwise wake up to a summary
 * with no idea it was interrupted mid-task, so a hidden custom message is
 * appended telling it to keep going from the summary's remaining work.
