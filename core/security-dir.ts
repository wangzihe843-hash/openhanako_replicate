/**
 * The one place that names the directory holding signing keys and grant records.

 * The name used to be spelled independently by everything that touched it: two
 * registries each declared their own copy of the constant, four key services
 * wrote the string inline, and the startup check that reports which registries
 * it created wrote it twice more. Nothing forced those spellings to agree, and
 * a list of directories that drifted from the name its writer actually used has
 * already cost real coverage in this area once: a pass ended up walking a path
 * that never existed and silently did nothing. Import the name from here rather
 * than spelling it again.
