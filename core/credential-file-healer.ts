/**
 * Startup pass that brings existing credential files up to the owner-only
 * storage contract.
 *
 * Writing new files with the right permissions only covers files written after
 * an upgrade. Anything already on disk keeps whatever permissions it was
 * created with, and a file that is never rewritten would keep them forever.
 * This runs on every startup rather than once, because permissions can also
 * drift afterwards: restoring from a backup, copying a data directory between
 * machines, or syncing it all reintroduce the original permissions long after
 * a one-shot migration would have finished.
 *
 * Running every time is safe because the pass is idempotent and silent when
 * there is nothing to correct. Every correction is logged, so this is a stated
 * contract about how the data directory is kept rather than an invisible fixup.
 *
 * Deleting this module means dropping its single call in the engine startup
 * sequence; nothing else depends on it.
